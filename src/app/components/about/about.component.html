        My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.  </div>

        I take great pride in not only being able to complete work to the high standard you expect but also go the extra mile wherever possible. I enjoy getting to know a business, its goals, and how I can best apply myself to make sure your website succeeds. For established clients, I particularly like analysing their metrics and making data-based decisions and recommendations, leading to better rates of success.    </p>
